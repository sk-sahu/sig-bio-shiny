## Why is Sig-Bio-Shiny?

The main motivation is to provide an easy interface to explore a Gene-set, without worrying about getting an organism database or conversion between particular R object which can be input to an available awesome R/Bioconductor package.

After downstream analysis of gene expression data, the end results are often a set of genes (may be a list of clustered genes, up/down regulated genes). To know their biological significance on a particular context (gene ontology or pathway) lot of statistical analysis available (Gene set enrichment, Over representation). Some awesome Bioconductor packages are developed for this purpose, But often the entry point might be difficult in some cases (mostly because of a particular input type). Also, besides that specifically for non-model organism it is little challenging.

Trying to solve these problems sig-bio-shiny is made. Completely made using R and Bioconductor. No manual database dump required, which make deployment simple with a single R Script. It takes full advantage of AnnotationHub package to get latest annotation for the selected organism and do statistical analysis on top of it using various well known packages.

## Background 

Sig-Bio-Shiny Application uses few of the Biocondutor packages underneath.

* [AnnotationHub] To get annotation information. [@AnnotationHub]
* [AnnotationDbi] To use some universal APIs for mapping data from OrgDb objects. [@AnnotationDbi]
* [clusterProfiler] To perform most of the analysis. [@clusterProfiler] and [@clusterProfiler.dplyr]
* [enrichplot] To plot most plots. [@enrichplot]
